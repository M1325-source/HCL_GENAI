Create a FastAPI application in Python that finds the meal with the least number of ingredients using TheMealDB API.

Initially, use the endpoint:
https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?f=a

Then extend the solution to fetch meals for all letters from 'a' to 'z' instead of just 'a'.

Requirements:
- Fetch all meals from TheMealDB API.
- Count only non-empty ingredient fields (strIngredient1 to strIngredient20).
- Return the meal that has the minimum number of ingredients.
- The response should include:
    - meal name
    - total ingredient count
    - list of ingredients
- Handle cases where meals may be null.
- Write clean, optimized, production-ready code.
- Use FastAPI and the requests library.
